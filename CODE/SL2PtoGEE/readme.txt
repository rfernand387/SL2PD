The SL2P matlab code produces an output project directory on a local machine that includes .mat files containing the neural networks required for prediction of each parameter and their uncertainty as well as specifying the domain of valid predictions.  

This directory contains functions that must be executed in a Matlab workspace to parse the required networks and domain database into csv files for upload to Google Earth Engine if they are to be used in the [[LEAF Toolbox application|https://github.com/rfernand387/LEAF-Toolbox]].  

Refer to the WIKI to run these functions.
