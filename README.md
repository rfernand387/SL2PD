# SL2PD
Simplified Level 2 Processor - Distributed

The Simplified Level 2 Processor â€“ D (SL2PD) produces estimates of canopy biophysical variables (outputs, Table 1) given inputs of either a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) or top-of-canopy (TOC) bi-directional reflectance spectrum together with the illumination, view and relative azimuth angles.  Separate non-linear regression models are used to estimate the expected value and the expected root mean square error (RMSE) of each output.  The regression estimators are optimized for multi-spectral (i.e. <10 bands with >10nm bandwidth) reflectance inputs but can be applied to arbitrary spectra as long as a radiative transfer model with sufficient accuracy to simulate such spectra is included in the processor.
