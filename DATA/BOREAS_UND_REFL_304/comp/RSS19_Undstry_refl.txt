BOREAS RSS-19 1994 Seasonal Understory Reflectance Data

Summary 

One objective of BOREAS is to further the understanding of the spectral 
bidirectional reflectance of typical boreal ecosystem stands in the 
visible/near-infrared regime.  An essential input for any canopy BRDF model is 
an accurate estimate of the average understory reflectance, both for sunlit and 
shaded conditions.  These variables can be expected to vary seasonally because 
of species-dependent differences in the phenological cycle of foliar display.  
In response to these requirements, the average understory reflectance for the 
flux tower sites of both the NSA (Thompson, Manitoba) and the SSA (Candle Lake, 
Saskatchewan) Study Areas (NSA and SSA) was observed throughout the year during 
five field campaigns.  This was done by measuring the nadir reflectance (400 to 
850 nm) of sunlit and shaded understory (vegetation and snow cover) along a 
surveyed LAI transect line (Chen, RSS-07) at each site near solar noon and 
documenting a average site reflectance.  Comparisons between sites reveal 
differences in the green and infrared regions of the spectra, because of the 
differing species in the understory for each site.  Temporal (seasonal) 
variation for each site was also observed, indicating the changing flora 
mixtures and changing spectral signatures as the understory matures during the 
growing season.

1.  DATA SET OVERVIEW

1.1  Data Set Identification

BOREAS RSS-19 1994 Seasonal Understory Reflectance Data

1.2  Data Set Introduction

Mean sunlit nadir understory reflectance spectra (400 to 850 nm) and their 
standard errors for the following canopy types are presented: Fen, Old Black 
Spruce (OBS), Old Jack Pine (OJP), and Young Jack Pine (YJP). Data for the tower 
flux sites are provided for both Northern Study Area (NSA) and Southern Study 
Area (SSA) locations for all five BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) 
field campaigns.  These five field campaigns are referred to as Focused Field 
Campaign-Winter (FFC-W) (Feb. 1994), FFC-Thaw (T) (Apr. 1994), Intensive Field 
Campaign (IFC)-1 (May/June 1994), IFC-2 (July 1994), and IFC-3 (Sept. 1994).

1.3  Objective/Purpose

The objective was to characterize seasonal change in the understory spectral 
reflectance at eight BOREAS tower flux sites, from February to September, for 
all five BOREAS field campaigns. 

1.4  Summary of Parameters

Each data file contains about 20 records of header information, such as:

Field Instrument, Reference Calibration Panel, 
Spectral Range, Wavelength Step, Spectrum Description, Field Of View (FOV), 
Field Campaign, Location, Latitude, Longitude, Date, Time, Solar Zenith Angle 
(SZA), Solar Azimuth, Illumination, Target Description, and Comments.

After the header information, there are reflectance and standard error 
measurements for each cover type in the file (one to three) given at each 
wavelength step within the spectral range.  This list is often about 150 records 
for the Spectron Engineering spectroradiometer (SE)-590, and 378 records for the 
Analytic Spectral Devices, Inc. (ASD) instrument.

1.5  Discussion

Mean sunlit nadir understory reflectance was determined by taking measurements 
at various points along a surveyed Leaf Area Index (LAI) transect [Chen, 1994], 
each observation target being chosen as representative of the local area, 
converting to reflectance, and producing a mean from all the derived 
reflectances along the transect line [White et al., 1995].  This provided mean 
understory reflectance, weighted by the component vegetation in the understory 
throughout the canopy site.

BOREAS sites have shown a definite and observable variation in the sunlit mean 
understory reflectance coefficients in the visible/near-infrared regions as a 
function of forest species stand. This can be related to change in vegetation in 
the understory, as well as the difference in growing conditions at each site. 
Phenological changes are also clearly observable, especially in the case of OBS, 
indicating the influence of changes in coverage of species type and growth on 
the nadir reflectance spectrum.

3.  Theory of Measurements

An estimate of the average spectral reflectance of the understory for each IFC 
was made in order to specify the boundary condition in canopy reflectance 
modeling for Remote Sensing Science (RSS) investigators.  The experimental 
design was focused on (i) determination of an appropriate method of spatial 
averaging, (ii) characterization of the spectral reflectance of the understory 
under direct Sun (Sun fleck) and shadow illumination conditions, and (iii) 
observations within 2 hours of local solar noon to generate measurements of the 
understory reflectance factor that is representative of remote sensing 
observations.

Observations of 5 to 40 individual spectra at each flux tower site, converted to 
reflectance by comparison to calibrated reference target, produced a mean 
reflectance along the transect line [White et al., 1995], considered to be 
representative of the understory at the date of the measurement.

4.  Equipment

4.1  Sensor/Instrument Description

Observations were made with the SE-590 field-portable data-logging 
spectroradiometer except during IFC-1 and some sites during IFC-3, where 
additional observations were obtained with the ASD instrument. The two 
instruments used during these campaigns were detector array field spectrometers 
with spectral ranges nominally 350-1100 nm but with data reported in the 400 to 
900 nm range.  The calibration panels used in the field were the white and gray 
side of a Kodak Gray Card (KGW-W and KGC-G respectively), which were spectrally 
and angularly calibrated at ISTS (Soffer et al. 1995).

4.1.1  Collection Environment

The understory conditions at the time of observations as indicated in Section 
7.2.2, Table 1, are:  Sun - target illuminated by unobscured direct Sun (in a 
Sun fleck), Shade - target outside of a Sun fleck area illuminated only by 
diffuse, undercanopy radiation, (s) - snow was observed, (v) - vegetation 
observed.
Observations were made under clear sky conditions or with minimal cloud cover, 
and in this case without clouds within 60 degrees of the Sun.  Observations were 
made within 2 hours of local solar noon.  The ambient air temperature range 
during observations varied from -35 °C during FFC-W to more than +25 °C in IFC-
2.

4.1.2  Source/Platform

SE-590.
ASD field spectroradiometer.
Both instruments were hand-held by the observer during measurements.

4.1.3  Source/Platform Mission Objectives

An estimate of the average spectral reflectance of the understory for each IFC 
was made in order to specify the boundary condition in canopy reflectance 
modeling for RSS investigators.

4.1.4  Key Variables

Spectral reflectance.

4.1.5  Principles of Operation

A nadir-viewing field spectrometer was used to measure the sunlit and shaded 
(where possible) understory reflectance at marked 10-m-interval transect lines, 
At each marker location an understory observation target was chosen as 
representative of the local area.  The observations were made in the nadir 
position, with care to minimize spectral contamination from observers and 
equipment.  The light source for all observations was natural illumination 
generated by solar direct/diffuse radiation that reaches the forest stand floor.  

4.1.6  Sensor/Instrument Measurement Geometry

The sensor was kept in a nadir viewing position for all measurements.  The 
height of the instrument was approximately 1 m, translating to an FOV with about 
a 5-6 m radius.

4.1.7  Manufacturer of Sensor/Instrument

The SE-590 was manufactured by:

Spectron Engineering, Inc.
225 Yuma Court
Denver, CO  80223
USA  

The ASD field spectroradiometer was manufactured by:

Analytic Spectral Devices, Inc.
4760 Walnut Street
Suite 105
Boulder, CO  80301
USA.  
Kodak, of Rochester, NY, manufactures the reference reflectance card.

4.2  Calibration

All calibrations of the instruments and the reflecting panels were performed at 
ISTS using standard laboratory methods.  Special care was taken to establish the 
calibration and estimates of reliability for the Kodak reference cards (KGCs) 
which were selected for use in the field because of their portability in a 
relatively difficult field environment and their reported (Milton, 1989).  
Laboratory bidirectional reflectance measurements were made between 15 and 80 
degrees at 5-degree intervals for all six KGCs used in the BOREAS field 
campaigns.  Absolute variability in the reflectance was less than 2% for the 
white cards and less than 1% for the gray cards, for the entire range of view 
angles.  Data were gathered with a fiber Ocean Optics array-spectrometer mounted 
on a goniometer and comparisons were made to a Spectralon calibration panel 
(Labsphere) to obtain absolute panel bidirectional reflectance distribution 
functions (BRDFs).  For validation of ISTS calibration methodology, York 
University's white Spectralon panel (Labsphere SN 3484 99%) and gray Spectralon 
panel (Labsphere SN 9485A 50%) were shipped to Dr. Elizabeth Walter-Shea (TE-12) 
for BOREAS panel field intercalibrations at the University of Nebraska. 
Comparisons between the Spectralon panel BRDF calibrations for view angles 
between 15 and 75 degrees were found to be within 2% for the white panel and 
within 1% for the gray panel.  The calibration procedures and results are 
described in more detail in Soffer et al. [1995]. 

4.2.1  Specifications
      
None given.

4.2.1.1  Tolerance

None given.

4.2.2  Frequency of Calibration

BRDF calibrations of the York University Spectralon panels was carried out prior 
to IFC-1 (1994), and comparative measurements were made between this Spectralon 
(white) and KGCs in the field at BOREAS on at least one occasion during each 
campaign.  The detailed BRDF characterization of six KGCs was carried out at 
ISTS after IFC-3. However, the consistency (<2% for white, <1% for gray) of 
results between KGCs used at BOREAS and fresh, unused cards indicates 
insignificant panel deterioration during the campaigns.
 
4.2.3  Other Calibration Information

None given.

5.  Data Acquisition Methods

A nadir-viewing field spectrometer was used to measure the sunlit and shaded 
(where possible) understory reflectance at marked 10-m intervals along the 
surveyed LAI transect line [Chen, 1994], which normally ran in a southeastern 
direction from each site tower.  At each marker location, an understory 
observation target was chosen as representative of the local area. The 
observations were made in the nadir position, with care to minimize spectral 
contamination from observers and equipment.

The FOV used allowed for an approximately 5-cm-radius area of understory to be 
observed, which was followed with a calibration panel observation taken within 1 
minute of the target measurement. The calibration panel used, was dependent on 
the conditions and availability during each campaign.

The above methodology was followed closely for all but one field campaign, IFC-
2.  During IFC-2, field observations were obtained for species-specific 
reflectances accompanied by aerial coverage estimates of the species, thereby 
allowing weighted-average understory reflectance spectra to be determined.

Each location was observed with the objective of viewing the average understory 
composition.  When more than one type of understory species mixing occurred at a 
marker, observations of each flora distribution were performed.  Thus, when 
averaged together, a mean understory reflectance weighted to each type of 
understory component population was possible.  In some cases, sites were divided 
specifically into small grids, with each grid being observed to provide a 
detailed understory BRDF for unique locations within the flux tower site, and 
where possible, observation runs were performed to correspond to Compact 
Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) multiangle, multialtitude observations 
also being performed.

6.  Observations

6.1  Data Notes

None given.

6.2  Field Notes

At some sites it was not possible to place the calibration panel level in the 
exact location of the target being observed.  Every effort was made to keep the 
panel level to the horizon and as close as possible to the target location.  It 
was sometimes necessary to raise the calibration panel above the understory to 
avoid contamination or destruction, which caused the incident irradiance field 
to be slightly different between panel and target observations, because of 
scattering, etc., in the overstory.  Such location discrepancies were kept at a 
minimum, and are not believed to have influenced the results significantly.

7.  Data Description

A summary of the complete understory data set is provided below in tabular form. 
This summarizes what data are available by specifying, for each data set, the 
field campaign, the study area, the flux tower site, the instrument used for the 
measurements, the type of Kodak reference cards used for in-field reflectance 
determination, the observation date, and comments regarding the illumination 
conditions or the understory targets.  More detailed information is provided in 
the spectral data headers.

7.1  Spatial Characteristics

7.2.3  Temporal Resolution
 
Observations were made only once at each tower site during each field campaign. 
For any such flux tower site, measurements were made at 10 to 40 individual 
understory locations along the 100- to 300-m LAI line within a 30- to 60-minute 
period near solar noon, in order to minimize changes in the SZA. From these data 
a mean mid-day understory reflectance was calculated.

7.3 Data Characteristics

Data characteristics are defined in the companion data definition file 
(und_refl.def).

7.4  Sample Data Record

Sample data format shown in the companion data definition file (und_refl.def).

8. DATA ORGANIZATION

8.1  Data Granularity

All of the 1994 Seasonal Understory Reflectance Data are contained in one 
dataset.

8.2  Data Format

The data files contain numerical and character fields of varying length 
separated by commas. The character fields are enclosed with  a single apostrophe 
marks. There are no spaces between the fields.  Sample data records are shown in 
the companion data definition files (und_refl.def).

9.  Data Manipulations

9.1  Formulae

As described more fully in Peddle et al. (1995), for any particular SZA, the 
target reflectance is calculated from:

target_ref. = (target_signal/reference_panel_signal)*panel_reflectance_at_SZA.

The panel reflectance at SZA is calculated by interpolation between laboratory 
panel BRDF calibrations (Soever et al., 1995).  The SZA is calculated from the 
local time and site longitude and latitude using standard ephemeris equations 
(see Peddle et al., 1995).

9.1.1 Derivation Techniques and Algorithms

It was possible to determine the SZA of each observation to a high degree of 
accuracy (within a few minutes of arc) using the tower flux site's latitude and 
longitude outlined in the BOREAS Experiment Plan Ver. 3.0, and the Local 
Standard Time (LST) of each observation [Observers Handbook, 1994]. A fourth- 
order polynomial was fitted to the calibration panel BRDF data provided in 
Soffer et al. [1995] for each SZA and spectrally interpolated [Peddle et al., 
1995]. This permitted the understory radiance spectra to be converted to nadir-
view reflectance. 

In the data reduction, no adjustments were made for the difference in SZA 
between the panel and target measurements, since they were usually taken within 
1 minute of each other.

9.2 Data Processing Sequence

9.2.1 Processing Steps

The processing steps to convert raw field spectrometer output spectrum to a 
reflectance spectrum are described above and in detail in Peddle et al. (1995). 
Subsequently, the observations under direct Sun illumination, for one flux tower 
site, during one field campaign, were simply averaged (no weighting) to provide 
the mean understory reflectance.  The standard error was also computed as the 
standard error of the mean (SE), which is related to the standard deviation (SD) 
by: SE = SD/vN. 

9.2.2 Processing Changes

All reported data were collected and processed in the same way, except for IFC-
1.  In this case, data collection followed a modified strategy in which at each 
site reflectance spectra were determined for different understory vegetation 
types (e.g., for lichen, for moss, for labrador tea, etc.), and the aerial 
coverage of each vegetation type was estimated by site spatial sampling.  In 
this case, the mean understory spectrum was calculated by weighting the 
reflectance of each understory type by the corresponding aerial coverage.

9.3 Calculations

9.3.1  Special Corrections/Adjustments

None.

9.3.2  Calculated Variables

Standard error.

9.4  Graphs and Plots

Summary graphs of understory reflectances are available from a paper submitted 
to the JGR special issue Miller et al., 1997).

10.  ERRORS

10.1  Sources of Error

Although the data were collected between 350-1100 nm, noise due to low signal 
levels and low detector efficiency in the regions below 400 nm and above 850 nm 
were observed from both spectrometers and are not presented here.

10.2  Quality Assessment

Error estimate curves for the understory reflectance are provided by showing the 
mean reflectance curve +/- one standard error.

10.2.1 Data Validation by Source

Data validation efforts included comparisons with reflectance measurements made 
by Laval University scientists (unpublished) and comparisons of mean reflectance 
spectra for one tower site for successive field campaigns, both of which 
demonstrate consistent results. 

10.2.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment

The seasonal variation in the tower site understory reflectances, the between-
site variations as reported in the JGR paper (Miller et al., 1997), and the 
reported standard errors for the spectra reported all suggest data of high 
quality.

10.2.3 Measurement Error for Parameters

Standard error spectra are provided along with the reflectance spectra.

10.2.4 Additional Quality Assessments

Visual review of plots and the standard error curves were used to assess data 
quality and to correct occasional recording errors.

10.2.5  Data Verification by Data Center

BOREAS Information System (BORIS) staff have looked at the data and plotted the 
spectra for all files.

11.  Notes

11.1  Limitations of the Data

There were some data gaps due to various weather and scheduling difficulties in 
the field. 

Calibrations of the panels used in the near-infrared region have not yet been 
completed.

11.2  Known Problems with the Data

None. 

11.3  Usage Guidance

Although understory reflectance characterization on a species basis may be of 
interest to some BOREAS scientists, it was not pursued in this study because it 
would have required a substantially different measurement strategy.  
Furthermore, a characterization of the complete BRDF of the understory was 
considered outside the scope of this study.

11.4  Other Relevant Information

None given.

12.  Application of the Data Set

The application of this data set is to estimate the average spectral reflectance 
of the understory in order to specify the boundary condition in canopy 
reflectance modeling for each season. 

13.  FUTURE MODIFICATIONS AND PLANS

None.

14.  Software

14.1  Software Description

In-house macros were written for Microsoft Excel that ingested spectrometer 
spectral scans for the target and the reference panel, applied corrections for 
the panel BRDF according to the local SZA, calculated the sample nadir 
reflectance and then the site-average reflectance spectrum and standard error. 
See Peddle et al. (1995) for a software and processing description.

14.2  Software Access

Because raw data files were not submitted, it is not useful to provide access to 
the processing software.  These data were collected specifically to generate 
site-average understory spectra.
