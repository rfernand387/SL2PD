are:

         Column Name                             Description
------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------
SITE_NAME                      The identifier assigned to the site by BOREAS, in
                               the format SSS-TTT-CCCCC, where SSS identifies
                               the portion of the study area: NSA, SSA, REG, 
                               TRN, and TTT identifies the cover type for the 
                               site, 999 if unknown, and CCCCC is the identifier
                               for site, exactly what it means will vary with 
                               site type.

SUB_SITE                       The identifier assigned to the sub-site by 
                               BOREAS, in the format GGGGG-IIIII, where GGGGG is 
                               the group associated with the sub-site 
                               instrument, e.g. HYD06 or STAFF, and IIIII is the 
                               identifier, for sub-site, often this will refer 
                               to an instrument.

                               terminated.

END_TIME                       The ending Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for the

                               degrees read clockwise describing the position of 
                               the sun where 0=north, 90=east, 180=south and 
                               270=west.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimum Data Value -- The minimum value found in the column.
Maximum Data Value -- The maximum value found in the column.
Missng Data Value  -- The value that indicates missing data. This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
Unrel Data Value   -- The value that indicates unreliable data.  This is used
                      to indicate an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the value was deemed to be
                      unreliable by the analysis personnel.
Below Detect Limit -- The value that indicates parameter values below the
                      instruments detection limits.  This is used to
                      indicate that an attempt was made to determine the
                      parameter value, but the analysis personnel determined
                      that the parameter value was below the detection
                      limit of the instrumentation.
Data Not Cllctd    -- This value indicates that no attempt was made to
                      determine the parameter value.  This usually
                      indicates that BORIS combined several similar but
                      not identical data sets into the same data base table
                      but this particular science team did not
                      measure that parameter.

Blank -- Indicates that blank spaces are used to denote that type of value.
N/A   -- Indicates that the value is not applicable to the respective column.
None  -- Indicates that no values of that sort were found in the column.
